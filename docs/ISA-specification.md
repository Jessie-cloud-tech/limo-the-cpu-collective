## 2.1 overview

|                               | Specification                                                                                                   | Rationale                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Architecture style            | 32-bit load-store                                                                                               | Restriction of memory access strictly to nka and beha to ensure complete operations in EX stage with multiple stalls                       |
| Register bank                 | 16 register files                                                                                               | Reduction of required multiplexers and, an increase in immediate bits                                                                      |
| Addressing modes              | Register direct, immediate, and register offset                                                                 | Does not require complex incrementing and keeps hardware ALU simple                                                                        |
| Memory, endianness, alignment | Byte-addressed, little-endian, word-aligned                                                                     | Enforces strict word alignment eliminates unaligned-access and multicycle memory cycle reads                                               |
| Instruction formats           | Fixed 32-bit length across the 4 instruction formats                                                            | Fixed instruction width and fixed register/opcode bit allow the ID stage to fetch source registers and decode opcode bits at the same time |
| Departures from RV321         | Reduced register file, increased immediate fields, omitted formats and lexical rule (orthography normalization) | Reuses saved register bits to expand immediate offsets for wider branch reach and simplifies logic for pipelining
